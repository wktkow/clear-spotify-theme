0. Important: make sure you have spotify installed already and you are logged in.

1. Make sure you have [spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) installed.

2. Run the installer:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wktkow/clear-spotify-theme/main/sh/install.sh | bash
   ```

   (Detects existing install, fully removes it, downloads fresh theme files, applies, and launches Spotify)

3. Enjoy!
